# Background

In 2018, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) reviewed a Board of Fish (BOF) proposal to create a live fish pot fishery for sablefish in Clarence Strait, Alaska. The primary concern among management biologists was the harvest of immature individuals, which comprise the "plate size" target in a live fish market. 

A pot fishery for sablefish exists in British Columbia, where they implemented a minimum size limit of xx cm and use a 3.5" escape ring on sablefish pot gear to reduce incidental capture of sublegal fish. However, survey data suggest  sablefish mature at larger sizes in Alaska than British Columbia. In order to reduce catch rates of immature sablefish, the Board of Fish adopted 

A fixed effect design was
